# xbow_asset (Resource)

Manages an XBOW Asset resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Basic asset with minimal configuration

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import an existing asset by its ID
terraform import xbow_asset.example "asset-abc123"
```
